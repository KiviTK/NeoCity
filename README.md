# NeoCity
A Neon-Blue color scheme for .Xresources, or anything else you might want

## How to use
Just copy the colors to your .Xresources, and realod it, if you use some
application that doesn't support colors from Xresources, I recommend
you use [xparser] (https://github.com/KiviTK/xparser) which is written
by me and is designed to parse files and insert Xresources colors
into static config files.
